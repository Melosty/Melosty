## W.I.P.
**A lightweight Minecraft: Java Edition Launcher.**

## Thanks to
- 忘却的旋律: The man who created the first and the most classic Minecraft launcher in China, which also named 忘却的旋律, I will never play Minecraft if I didn't use his launcher on the Chinese network, so neither other people in that period that Minecraft just entered China for a while. (In that time, Chinese network just start its development for years.) Also, his launcher is my idea to start this whole project. It's a symbol of my sweet childhood.
