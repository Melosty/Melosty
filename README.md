## W.I.P.
**Lightweight & Powerful Minecraft: Java Edition Launcher with Material Design 3.**

## Thanks to
- 忘却的旋律: The man who created the first and the most classic Minecraft launcher in China, which was also named 忘却的旋律, I would never have played Minecraft if I hadn't used his launcher on the Chinese network, so neither could other people in that period when Minecraft first entered China. (In that time, the Chinese network had only been developing for a few years.) Also, his launcher is my idea to start this whole project. It's a symbol of my sweet childhood.
